# OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration
# This is an example configuration for advanced trace processing
# Use this if you need to:
# - Route traces to multiple backends
# - Sample/filter traces based on attributes
# - Transform trace data
# - Add additional processing

receivers:
  # OTLP receiver for traces
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  # Batch processor - batches spans before sending
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 1024

  # Memory limiter - prevents OOM
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_mib: 512

  # Attributes processor - modify span attributes
  attributes:
    actions:
      - key: environment
        value: development
        action: insert

  # Sampling processor - reduce trace volume
  # probabilistic_sampler:
  #   sampling_percentage: 50  # Sample 50% of traces

  # Filter processor - drop specific traces
  # filter:
  #   traces:
  #     span:
  #       - 'attributes["http.target"] == "/health"'
  #       - 'attributes["http.target"] == "/ready"'

exporters:
  # Export to Jaeger

  # Export to logging (for debugging)

  # Export to Prometheus (for trace metrics)
